                <p>Twelfth century Norway. You’re traveling, trying to stay ahead of whatever is plaguing the area, and come across a village, thinking of staying the night. But this village is empty, every house with a red cross painted on the door,
                 save for one impossibly old woman in a red skirt, slowly sweeping the streets. You ask what happened here and she looks at you, slowly smiles, showing a mouth containing only three teeth, and says that you’re too late, everyone here 
                 is dead, but if you let her ride with you she’ll tell you the story on the way. You agree and help her onto your wagon. As you start back on your journey, you wipe at your nose, and come back with blood.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content__conteiner">
                <p>This one seems incredibly apt with the current global news. Pesta is from Norwegian folklore dating back to the spread of the Black Plague, named after the Norwegian word for the pandemic itself. She is the one who spreads the disease itself,
                     and you can know her by her red skirt and she will be carrying either a rake or a broom. If she has a rake you’re lucky—some of you may survive the coming sickness. If she is carrying her broom, beware—everyone in town will die.
                      The Black Plague itself was terrifying, wiping out a third of Europe’s population just like that. But the way the disease made us act, turning on each other at the slightest implication of any sickness and blaming each other for the causing the sickness to begin with.
                     I just want to see a movie where all this goes down in a small town after a little old lady comes to visit and watches it all fall apart with a smile, broom on her shoulder. She moves on the the next town after everyone dies, humming a simple tune, and the screen fades to black.</p>

                <p>Pesta wiped out whole communities. People died in their beds – or on the paths walking through the landscape. Children were left orphaned and alone.</p>
                <p>The tales say that it took no longer than three days to die.</p>
                <p>The disease worked with such speed, that people often were unable to free their livestock from the stables and the sheds. Without food and care, the animals soon succumbed to thirst and hunger</p>
                <p>Before long, the last man, woman, and domestic animal were gone, and everything was still.
                    Years passed, and Mother Nature slowly reclaimed the buildings and the fields that people had laboured and struggled so hard for.</p>

                <p>One day, Pesta came to a lake and called out for the ferryman to take her across.
                    She wore a blue skirt this time, and at first, the man did not recognise her.</p>
                <p>Gradually, however, it dawned on him who was there with him in the boat. He pleaded with her to spare his life. If she did, he would let her good deed be the payment for the boat journey.</p>
                <p>Pesta conferred with a large book that she had in her lap, and then answered quietly: “Sadly, I cannot spare your life, but I can make your death an easy one”.</p>
                <p>When the man returned home, he was as tired as he had never been before. He stumbled to his bed – and moments later he was gone.</p>
